# Sample vault file for PowerScale MCP credentials.
#
# AUTOMATED SETUP (Recommended):
#   Run: ./setup.sh
#   This will prompt you for cluster credentials and vault password,
#   then create and encrypt vault.yml automatically.
#
# MANUAL SETUP (if needed):
#   1. Copy this file:         cp vault-sample.yml vault.yml
#   2. Edit with your values:  vi vault.yml
#   3. Encrypt the vault:      echo -n "your-vault-password" | ansible-vault encrypt vault.yml
#   4. Start with password:    VAULT_PASSWORD='your-vault-password' docker-compose up
#
# IMPORTANT: The vault password is never stored on disk.
# You must provide it via VAULT_PASSWORD environment variable at runtime.
#
# The first cluster listed becomes the default target at server startup.
# Use the powerscale_cluster_select MCP tool to switch clusters at runtime.
