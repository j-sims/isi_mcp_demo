# The following secrets are created imperatively by deploy-minikube.sh
# and are NOT managed by kustomize:
#   isi-mcp-credentials  (vault-password key)
#   isi-mcp-vault        (vault.yml key)
#
# Run `kubectl apply -k k8s/` only AFTER running deploy-minikube.sh,
# which creates the required secrets first.
